Refer "Report 1.pdf" and "Report 2.pdf" for more details of the two simmilar projects.

Refer "1.Rmd" and "2.Rmd" for codes of both the projects.

These projects were the most difficult ones that I have ever done. It was not because the methodology was something different or there were complications in the data or I was expected to do something new. It was difficult only due to the sheer volume of data and the quality of analysis that was needed to be delivered. Feature Selection techniques like Lasso, forward selection and backward selection did help to reduce the number of columns but the reduced number of variables were still alot.

Because of the huge volume of data, it was difficult to make sense of patterns that were emerging, subsetting the data did prove to be of some help. But even when you subset, you still had to individually analyze each subset which was a very rigorous process.

Simple procedures and codes which usually took a minute took 30-45 minutes. This became more troublesome when 5 predictive models took a total of 9-10 hours to run and this procedure had to be repeated 3 times. So just running all the models took 27-30 hours of computational time per project. Two projects added up to 54-60 hours of computational time.

However the main problem was the computational power of the systems that we were working on which were our personal laptops. With stronger systems, calculations would have been done quicker and easier.
